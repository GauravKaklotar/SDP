  /// These UTF-16 code units have the same value as Unicode
      code points for most of the characters you see on a day to
      day basis. However, 16 bits only give you 65,536

      new country flag. It uses a pair of code points called
      t to represent a flag. Thatâ€™s what you see in
      the example for the Mongolian flag above. 127474 is the code

      code for the regional indicator symbol letter N. MN represents
      Mongolia.
